# Version Control Infos for Administration Console
[![ko-fi](https://www.ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/W7W7VS24)

This extension adds a "Version Information" tab to the hybris administration console.

The displayed properties (`hacvcsinfo/resources/hacvcsinfo/vcs.properties`) are generated in `buildcallbacks.xml`, and contain:

- commit hash
- tag
- branch name

of the current git HEAD.

This really helps to find out what version is actually deployed to a given server, as the property file is included in the zip files generated by `ant production`.

(Feel free to adjust the callback to include any other information you need, the new tab displays all properties without
any filter.)
